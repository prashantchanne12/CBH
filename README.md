# Career Begins Here (24 hrs Hackathon Project)

## Problem Statement

The syllogistic figure of one's career is one of most important factors which decides the success rate of it. An active topic of debate which still remains is the age at which a person should be able to make or be ready with this schema of his/her career. Career buddy sets up a platform where a person is guided to understand this particularly required schema and the related tools and resources required to execute it. An environment where a simple pathway is provided to understand the pros and cons of one's goals and ambitions at any stage of his academic life. It particularly provides the user with proper and precise guidance(just like your buddy would help you out in problems)
